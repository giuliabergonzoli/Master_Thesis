Proposal of an innovative statistical method, called ordinal mixed- effects random forest (OMERF), which extends the application of random forest to the analysis of hierarchical data, for ordinal categorical responses.
This method preserves the flexibility and ability of modeling complex patterns of both categorical and continuous variables, typical of tree-based ensemble methods.
At the same time, OMERF takes into account the nested structure of hierarchical data, modeling the dependence structure that exists at the highest level of the hierarchy and allowing statistical inference on this structure.
We carry out a simulation study in order to validate the performance of our proposed method and to compare OMERF to the existing classical models.
In the case study, we apply OMERF to model students of an important high school in Milan who may be at risk of dropping out of school and generally to predict their academic progress. The model was able to identify discriminating student characteristics and estimate the effect of each class to which students belong.
