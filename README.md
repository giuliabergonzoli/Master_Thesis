In this work an innovative statistical method is proposed. The model is called Ordinal Mixed-Effect Random Forest (OMERF) and extends the use of random forest
to the analysis of hierarchical data to model ordinal categorical responses.
It preserves the flexibility and ability of modeling complex patterns of both categorical and continuous variables, typical of tree-based ensemble methods.
At the same time, OMERF takes into account the nested structure of hierarchical data, modeling the dependence structure that exists at the highest level of the hierarchy and allowing statistical inference on this structure.
In this study, a simulation is conducted to validate the performance of the proposed method and to compare OMERF against existing classical models.
The application of OMERF is exemplified in a case study focusing on modeling students at risk of failure from a prestigious high school in Milan, and generally on predicting their academic progress. 
The model is able to identify discriminating student characteristics and estimate the effect of each class to which students belong.
